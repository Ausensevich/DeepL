# Deepl Limit Remover

Deepl Limit Remover is a Chrome extension designed to bypass the translation limitations imposed by Deepl by removing cookies from deepl.com. This allows users to continue using the Deepl translation service even after reaching the daily limit.

**Please note**: The effectiveness of this extension is not guaranteed as Deepl and other similar services may use various means to track user usage, such as IP addresses, session identifiers, or more persistent browser storage techniques. Furthermore, please be aware that bypassing usage limits imposed by a service may violate their terms of use and may result in suspension or termination of access to that service. Make sure to understand and respect the terms of use of Deepl before proceeding.
